# Wolf-Sheep-Predation

This is a model I made for a college subject Modelling and Simulation, where I tried to simulate wolf-sheep predation. Wolves and sheep are randomly spawned across the field. , where sheep serve as prey for the wolves. Each step consumes energy for both wolves and sheep—wolves must hunt sheep, while sheep must eat grass to restore their energy. When sheep eat the grass, the area turns brown, and the grass gradually regrows over time. Additionally, both wolves and sheep have a limited lifespan and a certain reproduction rate, ensuring population continuity.

This model can be considered stable because, despite its complexity, it provides a detailed representation of interactions between populations and their environment. By introducing additional elements such as energy requirements, resource regeneration time (like grass), limited lifespan, and the possibility of individual reproduction, the model becomes more realistic and more accurately reflects real ecological processes.

## How to use it
To start, click the setup button to initialize the model, which will generate a set number of sheep and wolves randomly placed on the terrain. Grass will also be set with different growth stages.

Click go to run the simulation. Sheep move around and eat grass to gain energy, while wolves hunt sheep to survive. The energy levels and ages of the agents change dynamically over time. You can enable options to display energy and age values above the agents. The terrain colors indicate the presence and growth stages of grass.

Before running the simulation, you can adjust parameters such as the initial number of sheep and wolves, the energy gained from food and prey, and the grass regrowth rate. Experimenting with different values will show how they affect the ecosystem’s balance.
