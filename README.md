# Wolf-Sheep-Predation

This is a model I made for a college subject, where I tried to simulate wolf-sheep predation. Wolves and sheep are randomly spawned across the field. , where sheep serve as prey for the wolves. Each step consumes energy for both wolves and sheepâ€”wolves must hunt sheep, while sheep must eat grass to restore their energy. When sheep eat the grass, the area turns brown, and the grass gradually regrows over time. Additionally, both wolves and sheep have a limited lifespan and a certain reproduction rate, ensuring population continuity.

This model can be considered stable because, despite its complexity, it provides a detailed representation of interactions between populations and their environment. By introducing additional elements such as energy requirements, resource regeneration time (like grass), limited lifespan, and the possibility of individual reproduction, the model becomes more realistic and more accurately reflects real ecological processes.
